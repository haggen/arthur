          <p>
            Just as I have benefited greatly from source code that was readily available, I seek to release everything I do
            under an open source license so others might benefit as well. Iâ€™ve done coding guides, game mods in Lua, Bash
            scripts, several JavaScript and Ruby libraries and some web applications in Go and React. Many of these I still
            maintain to this day and you can find them on <a href="https://github.com/haggen">my GitHub profile</a>.
